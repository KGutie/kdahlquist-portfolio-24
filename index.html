        <h1>About Me ☺︎</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Kristy Dahlquist!
        <p> This is my story from dirt to digital.</p>

        <p>I most recently worked at Auth0 by Okta in Developer Marketing for about 4 years, where I had the privilege of managing a vibrant developer community through the Auth0 Ambassador Program. Before that, I spent over a decade in outdoor education and adventure travel with renowned companies like REI and Dagger Kayaks, orchestrating large-scale international adventures, training and guiding dedicated teams, and ensuring the success of our programs. I like to think of this journey as moving from "dirt to digital." I find joy in kayaking on the ocean and exploring the world of coding. My aspiration is to become a great storyteller, driven by the belief that every company is a tech company. Engaging people in their next adventure, whether technical or tangible, begins with leveraging the power of digital tools. Let's dig deeper.</p>
        <p>While my background working in the outdoor industry sounds like a far cry from the tech world, it isn't so different when you look at the big picture. From click to class, from email to real experience, I love connecting, creating, and integrating community and user experiences whether they're totally digital or completely human! You can't get people hitting the dirt for their next adventure without the digital touch. </p>
       <p>And speaking of digital dirt, I'm here to solve problems, clean up dirty processes, create and execute new ideas, and drive results with creativity and a growth mindset. Because let's face it, a little dirt is essential for real growth and progress! </p>
        
              <p></p>

        <p>Customer-obsessed. Curious. Community focused. Data Driven. Operationally sound. Technically minded. Super tidy.</p>
        <p> That's me!</p>
